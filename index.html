    <h1>Aai's love of me</h1>
    <p>Since I was born, my Aai did everything she could for me, since my mom is a government officer, my Aai took up the role of a mother for me, she did everything for me first hand when I lived with Aai Baba and mom from birth till 11 when I moved to Indore, she was my mother, my bestfriend and my secret buddy, for which I am eternally grateful for her</p>
    <p>When my mom used to beat me for not concentrating, it was my Aai who came and asked her to slow down, when I wanted to eat maggi and mom didn't want to make it, Aai did</p>
    <p>My Aai was not only the best grandma in the world but also the best mom too, all 3 of her daughters are now in high places, 1 in WCD, 1 in excise, and the other is a non practising doctor, I know from my mom and mausi that Aai never beat them, she didn't even give them preferential treatment other than the one given to students at Vidhya Vijay Baal Mandir, where Aai taught and her 3 daughters went to</p>
    <h1>My love for Aai</h1>
    <p>When a person is a child, they get unconditional treatment from almost everyone around them, and unconditional love, from probably only parents, grandparents and I can't remember anyone else who has given me </p>
    <p>However, children being children can't understand it, they pretty much take everyone around them for granted, I did too, when my Aai and Baba used to flower me with love, unconditional and full of grace, I used to get angry at them, fight them prettu much all my childhood, up until the age of 11, when I remember for the 1st time wondering how I am so unfair to Aai and should keep my anger down</p>
    <p>However, at the age of 11 when I moved out to Indore, actually even before that when I knew I am going to move out, I deep down knew how much I loved my grandparents, they gave me everything when I had nothing</p>
    <p>Then Aai fell in aangan in Rajgarh, a town around 200 kilometers from Indore, I was really scared back then, I coudn't fathom think of my Aai going away from me, I remember reaching the hospital she was in Bhopal, I slept there at night, it was 28th of April, my birthday, I remember the good nurses wishing happy birthday to me and asking me jokingly to give them chocolates</p>
    <p>Then came COVID-19, which took away my entire grandparents line, my happiness, my Baba, my Dada ji, my Dadi ji from me, and my Aai fell again, this time to never walk again without a walker</p>
    <p>My dadi got cancer, we found it in the beginning of 2020, then her condition worsened, and my dada ji got alone, and got paralysis, in 2021, early May, dadi went to Pachore to meet with Dada ji in his last few days, in early May I got a call from chacha ji around 4 or 5 AM, he asked to talk to mom but I was too lazy and didn't give it to her(I actually insisted), which reamins one of my biggest regrets</p>
    <p>Then 2 or 3 days later my Aai fell, this time in front hall of the quarter, I sat with her for about an hour, holding her while she was in extreme pain, I feel proud of it till today, she was taken to hospital, then days later my Baba, who was in a liquid state since a few weeks died, just </p>
    <p>We didn't tell Aai, she kept asking if Baba ate, slept at time everyday and we just lied to her, I am happy I did seva of Baba by massaging his feet a few days before he died, I just feel guilty for not talking to him more since we didn't expect him to die before completing his century</p>
    <h1>My seva of Aai</h1>
    <p>I am going to proudly admit that I stayed near Aai and my Dadi for whole 2 years until COVID ended, I still regret till this day, and will for my whole life that I didn't do seva for my dadi while she writhled in extreme pain because of stomach cancer, I at times got irritated for which I put all blame on myself</p>
    <p>Just as my 10th exams were going to start, my dadi's condition worsened and my dad was called to Rajgarh where my mom did seva of my Aai and my dadi for a last meet, I gave my 10th while living with Rekha mausi, and went to Rajgarh the day after my final exam of Sanskrit</p>
    <p>There, my Dadi was there, in extremely weak condition, in almost unrecognizable appearance than she was last year, I, still an idiot, coldy said "Ha dadi", and she smiled at me with what probbaly was all her strength, then I went to nearby room near Aai, and my Dadi writhled in pain, repeatedly chanting "Ram utha le re", I should have went to see her at that time but I extremely regrettebly didn't</p>
    <p>Then at a moment when neither my dad, nor my mom or Rachana bua was there with dadi, she passed away, not getting a final meeting with her younger son, it was told to us that she will only live 6 months but she lived </p>
    <p>After that, 1 year later approximately,I stayed with Aai, infact for 2 months when nobody was there in the house except me and her, I took her to washroom (in that I regrettebly admit that I did some 'makkari' and sometimes didn't even bring her to washroom), she went herself and was pretty lazy, which would have surely put me in a LOT of trouble but she out of love never told it to anyone, only speaking of me lovingly </p>
    <p>I extremely regrettebly even regretted staying with her a little bit because of my procrastination in studies(which was my own problem but I selfishly put the blame on others which I still regret)and even told it to mom but now I will happily trade in 100s of such regrets for doing seva of Aai while she lovingly tells me what to do and guides me </p>
    <p>Then I went to Indore, and there I fully understood all the mistakes I have made in self reflection, I now heavily regret of my neglect towards my Dada and Dadi ji, and my makkari when doing seva of Aai</p>
    <h1>My year long saga with Aai</h1>
    <p> I failed JEE, I went to Ashoknagar to stay with mamma and Aai for my drop year, and there I did what I could for Aai, what I regretted not doing before for my Dadi, I had fun with Aai, I regrettebly got angry sometimes but it never was much of an issue, it was probably my best year in life, I started going to mandir in this stay(made it my everysay habit after I came here for vacation before starting college towards the end of her life)</p>
    <h3>I came for summer vacation here for around 3 months, after having a fight with dad over tenants in Indore, Aai and I had such an amazing tuning here that I started praying to the Gods and Goddesses to just give her extra 3 years on life, and I will visit here every vacation I get from college, for 3 months I had a level of fun, happiness and closeness with Aai that I doubt I will ever experience this in my life ever</h3>
    <h3>Aai was a complete fan of mine, and I was a complete fan of hers, everytime someone gave her something to eat she asked them to give it to me too, almost everyone remarked that I was most loved and dotted on by her, I was deep down scared fo anything bad happening to her the entire time, I at times saw some signs of her not wanting to live(because of Baba's death), but she probably only lived for me</h3>
    <h3>After staying with her for 3 months, I went to Indore, before going she told me to eat daal and roti everyday and to not fight with my father, both of which I am going to fullfill in my life now, however just as when the car was about to go, she wanted to sit on the door near the entrance of the house to give me a good send off, however due to the bed near not being good for sitting and her having problems to sit, she coudn't wave at me on time and the car sped off without worrying about her, I REALLY wanted to saya  final bye to her but because of my weakness I coudn't askt he driver to stop</h3>
    <h2>Which is my one of the biggest regrets in life, not being able to say a good final goodbye to my Aai</h2>
    <h3>Before going we had a viral fever at house, first mom got it from her work, then Aai then me, I ffelt it in the morning of going to Indore but by we got to Indore I was totally fatigued, Aai was also not well since 2-3 days</h3>
    <h1>Aai died on 12th of Auguest, early hours, I got to know after I woke up at 8:30 from mom's call, I at first got to know that she was very ill but dad later told me she died, I got heartbroken, I cried, first time in months, it was really too heartbreaking for me, I love you Aai, my baati waali bai, I love you so much I can not even tell it just by speaking, everyday my heart writhles in pain for not talking to you after I got to Indore over phone, I should have, I almost did too but it was yog of us not talking, like how you never had the chance to talk to Baba in his final days</h1>
<h1>We got to Ashoknagar, because of the overwhelming crowd in the house I could never get the last chance to hug my Aai while she was there, not saying anything while she would have showered me with love if she was alive, I still regret not having the courage to just hug her and cry like a child at that moment, I couldn't, but now I will never be this weak in my life, I will muster up courage so a regret of this level will never be with me in my entire life </h1>
<p>Today is 14th of August, 2025, it is 23:18 right now, we are going to Indore tomorrow, I will never be the same in my life, I will neither be able to give anyone so much love, nor will anyone give me this much unconditional love in my entire life, the most loving part of my life is gone, and I am here sitting full with regrets, primarily towards my grandparents, and I will take these regrets will me to wherever I go</p>
<h1>Aai, I will do something useful for the first time in my life and make sur to give you my karma so you can have a better afterlife, and my message to ANYONE reading this is, you probably won't ever know the love and affection your grandparents gave you, they are wail, old, they cannot show their feelings like you because of age and different mindset, at an age you stop loving them and start treating them as side characters, please don't , do seva of them or atleast go and have a chat with them, for you, they are probably just a small time in your life but for them you are their entire life, blood and flesh, they are your first bestfriends but you are their last</h1>
<p>Abeer Sharma
<p>23:23, 14th of August, 2025</p>
<p>Om Shanti, Aai</p>
<p>I will now research on how to msurely give my Aai the best afterlife I can, if she needs, I am willing to give my own karma to her for  good afterlife, I am a failure of a grandchild, and a son for not completing my parents' dream of getting in an IIT, a rascal, I just want to be useful for once in my life</p></body>
